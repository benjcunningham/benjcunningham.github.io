```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path="../assets/")
```

I love the idea of literate programming with R Markdown. Over the last 18 months, I've fallen away from daily R use, but I've been meaning to get back into writing with `.Rmd`. I recently scrapped my old blog and decided to start a fresh one, so thought this would be the time to get back into the habit.

I'm still blogging with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, but this time around I'm aiming for a workflow that at least _feels_ like it has less dependencies (maybe it won't, but I'll probably learn some things along the way to failure). Previously, I wrote all my posts in `.Rmd`, compiled them with **knitr** and **rmarkdown** via `servr::jekyll()`, and pushed to my GitHub remote from there. ~~This time, I've moved all the compilation into a self-rolled script so everything can be built or served with a Makefile.~~

~~If you're interested in how this is done, check out the repo here and pay special attention to `./Makefile` and `./build.R`. Instead of `jekyll serve`, you can use `make serve` to compile the `.Rmd` into `_posts/` and then automatically serve the site from there.~~

*(Edit: July 10)* Now all of the R Markdown compilation is kicked off by a ridiculously simple Jekyll `:pre_render` hook:

```ruby
Jekyll:Hooks.register :site, :pre_render do |doc, payload|
    `Rscript build.R`
end
```

I just have to run `jekyll serve` like usual. ðŸ¥³

For posterity (and so I can review all the CSS), here's some placeholder text demoing what works:

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Other Languages

Code chunks in other languages can also be embedded. Create a fenced code block that begins with a declaration like this:

<pre><code>```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5, 6]})
df
```</code>
</pre>

The block will be executed and run like R code chunks, for example:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5, 6]})
df
```

Objects in other languages can be accessed in subsequent chunks, as with R chunks, like:

```{python}
import torch

x = torch.tensor(df.values, dtype=torch.long)
x.size()
```

Many objects are also easy to share back and forth across Python and R environments using the `py` object exported by **reticulate** like:

```{r}
str(reticulate::py$df)
```

## $$\LaTeX$$

It is also possible to include both inline and fenced math using the `$$` syntax. For example, $$f(x) = tan^{-1}(x)$$, or:

$$
f(x) =
\left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    0 & \text{if } x \lt 0\\
    x & \text{if } x \ge 0
  \end{array}
\right.
$$
