Shelley and I decided to fly to Copenhagen during the long July 4 work holiday.
I’ve had a sweet spot for Scandinavian noir for a few years, so the city has
been on my list for awhile. We settled on the idea back in January and
committed to flights not long after, but we really didn’t start planning until
earlier this week — we’re looking forward to exploring the City of Spires from
scratch.

## Saturday

### 2 P.M. The Coziest Airport

Oddly, the first thing we found ourselves fixated with in Denmark was the
beautiful wooden floor of Copenhagen Airport (CPH). Silently, we raced down the
dark, parquet halls (seriously, we couldn’t get enough of those floors) to
immigration, blissfully unaware that our time in Scandinavia would move at
a delightfully slower pace than at home in Manhattan.

### 3 P.M. Settling in by the Sea

After a 30 minute cab ride through the mist, Shelley and I were already
enchanted with the city. Our driver pointed out cobblestone storefronts, grassy
wetlands, and bikers — oh, yes, the bikers — before dropping us in front of our
“cozy cottage by the sea” Airbnb.

Grethe greeted us at the door and showed us around her charming summer home
before giving us bear hugs and excusing herself to her granddaughter’s seventh
birthday. Exhausted from our overnight flight, Shelley and I took the next few
hours off to nap and catch up on the best Danish-dubbed American television we
never knew we were missing.

### 8 P.M. Colorful Canals

Somewhat unaware of the time, but also just starving for a real meal, we
ventured out into breezy Copenhagen for the first time. Not quite sure if the
sun would even set at this time of the year (it finally did, just before 10
P.M.), we walked the mile from our home for the week to Copenhagen’s #1 photo
op destination: Nyhavn.

Expecting the Danish version of Times Square, we were pleasantly surprised to
find the canal lively yet navigable. After a quick surveillance of the pastel
veneers that line the water, Shelley and I ducked in to Cap Horn for our first
local meal: lamb, venison, potatoes, and greens.

Feasting (at least relative to well-mannered European portions) away on the
boardwalk in an ocean of merry Danes, we were finally off duty from our lives
back home.

## Sunday

### 4 P.M. Jet Lag and Afternoon Views

A night that never quite reached astronomical twilight left us snoozing through
our morning, and then afternoon, alarm clocks. But when we finally crawled out
of bed, Shelley and I were determined to fit an entire afternoon’s worth of
sightseeing into the remaining daylight.

Only a couple blocks to the east, we started our day at Langelinie, drifting
through the park and promenade with a few hundred other tourists freshly
unloaded from mega buses on the pier. First up, Copenhagen’s most iconic
symbol, The Little Mermaid (Den lille Havfrue).

From the waterfront, we retreated back inland through Churchillparken, a quiet,
terraformed green space commemorating Winston Churchill and the British-led
liberation of Denmark during World War II, and then onto Kastellet, another
terraformed star fortress.

After circling the island citadel, Shelley and I walked south towards the heart
of the city. On our way, we paused to gawk at Copenhagen’s other universal
icon, Frederik's Church (Frederiks Kirke), an emerald domed Lutheran church and
the focal point of the city’s skyline. Then, just a few hundred yards away, we
lingered in the massive courtyard of Amalienborg, the four-palace home of the
Danish royal family.

### 6 P.M. Street Food Dinner

Starving again, having missed out on nearly another full day of Danish cuisine,
Shelley and I fervently crossed the city’s inner harbour via pedestrian bridge
and darted to dinner at Copenhagen Street Food. Distracted for a few minutes by
an impromptu Yoko Ono art exhibit, we finally ducked inside the market and
wandered the bustling maze of food stalls. Smørrebrød from Handmade, barbecue
pork sandwiches from Oink Oink, duck fat fries from Copper and Wheat, and
a couple dark ales from Stormly kept us nibbling for 90 minutes.

### 8 P.M. Royal Palaces

Stuffed from dinner, we dodged the shadows slowly creeping across the inner
city. With the grounds deserted in the after-hours of the weekend, Shelley and
I floated through the government halls of Christiansborg Palace and the Royal
Stables (Kongelige Stalde), some of the most beautiful cityscapes we’d see on
our trip. A few dozen Instagram ops later, we strayed back to Nyhavn and closed
out our night with ice creams from Vaffelbageren.

## Monday

### 8 A.M. Monday Morning Commute

After debating whether we had the nerve to hoof it with Copenhagen’s leagues of
bicycle commuters, Shelley and I opted to play it safe on the S-train for our
morning commute. A short walk to Østerport Station and 20 minutes figuring out
how to buy a ticket later, we were on our way to Copenhagen City Hall
(Københavns Rådhus). Still half an hour early for our tour, we perched along
the western wall of Tivoli Gardens, spying on the commotion of the city’s
laborers crossing a world of tourists.

### 9 A.M. The Grand Tour

To better investigate the 99.9% of Denmark that isn’t urban Copenhagen, Shelley
and I signed up for a Hamlet Tours day trip, seeking out northern Zealand’s
most famous cathedrals and castles. For six or so hours, we piled into
a 16-person mini-bus and cruised through the island’s rural parts, cameras in
hand. Led by the fearless Maya, a university student and Roskilde native, we
probed UNESCO World Heritage sites, local diners, and medieval mansions.

First up, Roskilde Cathedral and its reserve of royal burial chapels. Next,
a quick hour at the nearby Viking Ship Museum diving into the research of
preserved warships. Not far away in Hillerød, tuna sandwiches at Cafe Valentin
and a jaw dropping waltz through the never-ending halls of Frederiksborg
Castle.  Finally, live Shakespeare in Kronborg (a.k.a. Elsinore in Hamlet) and
one final parking lot dash through a sudden downpour before heading back to the
city.

### 6 P.M. Dinner Downtown

Dropped off from the tour, Shelley and I again found ourselves at Nyhavn
looking for food. Fortunately, having done some master Yelping the night
before, this time we had reservations.

A few blocks away, we arrived at Kjøbenhavn for the Danish (but more filling)
equivalent of a tasting. The cute bistro’s tiny menu packed a punch; Shelley
and I opted for 3 courses of salmon, steak tips, and sorbet that left us more
satisfied than any meal thus far. Already happy with our choice, we were even
more pleased to see our decision further validated as night fell and the snug
room filled to capacity with more reservations.

## Tuesday

### 1 P.M. The National Museum

No trip abroad would be complete without at least one formal museum visit.
Since we had no intention of leaving stones unturned in Denmark, Shelley and
I made sure to stop by the National Museum of Denmark (Nationalmuseet) for
a few hours on Tuesday afternoon.

### 4 P.M. More Street Food

Still not sick of castles, we next took off for the seemingly out of place
Rundetårn in inner city Copenhagen. The 17th-century astronomical observatory,
named for its helical, sloping staircase also placed us at the doorstep of the
apparently famous døp, a gourmet hot dog pølser stand. And yeah, as promised,
it was pretty great.

After a bit a people-watching and arguing about whether we were sitting in
front of the original Joe & the Juice (we weren’t), we headed to Torvehallerne,
another mostly-open-air market in central Copenhagen, to grab pastries from
Brioche Dorée.

### 5 P.M. Strolling Through the Park

Finally, Shelley and I closed out our time in Denmark by strolling north
through Østre Anlæg, a public park, and the University of Copenhagen Botanical
Garden. As we meditated on our week for 90 minutes atop the rolling hills and
ponds, we realized we still had one thing left to do in Copenhagen…

Hurriedly, we raced to the Netto down the street from our Airbnb for one final
helping of rugbrød, lox, and, well, Danishes.
