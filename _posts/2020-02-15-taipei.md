It was actually pretty nice visiting Taiwan in the midst of the coronavirus
(COVID-19) frenzy. Importantly, we weren't very worried (whether we should have
been or not). The less important, but convenient, part was that it was super
easy to get into restaurants without much of a wait. Here's where we ate:

## Taipei

### Meals

- [Din Tai Fung](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13808515-d2244808) -- The super
  famous restaurant you've probably heard about.  Everything is as good as they
  say. Shelley and I love dim sum, so went to DTF three times.
- [Yong He Soy Milk King](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13806951-d13354853) --
  I'm not a big fan of soy milk, but this was a pretty good place to grab
  breakfast.
- [Huang Ji Braised Pork](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13808671-d6152642) --
  Conveniently right around the corner from our hotel. We kind of let this one
  come and go without a lot of fanfare, but it was _really_ good.
- [12 Hotpot](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13811269-d8469448) -- We ate here
  with a high school friend of Shelley's. Your typical,
  each-person-gets-their-own hot pot.

### Desserts

- [Ice Monster](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13808515-d8801469) -- Something
  between flavored ice and "proper" dairy-based ice cream, and a few other
  treats (which I prefer) like sesame balls.

### Night Markets

- [Gongguan](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13808853-d6623510)
- [Ximending](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13806951-d7811748)

## Taichung

### Meals

- [Chun Shui Tang](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13806459-d5453072) --
  Controversially, the original home of bubble tea. Some good food on the menu,
  but c'mon, you have to go for the milk tea.
- [Modern Toilet Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13806951-d1437880) --
  Not good! But maybe we shouldn't have been too surprised by that...

### Desserts

- [Miyahara Ice Cream](https://www.tripadvisor.com/g13792757-d3539748) --
  Elegant first floor, where they sell pineapple cakes and other sweets out of
  glass display cases. The dining room is upstairs, where you can overindulge
  on cake and ice cream trying to meet the minimum spend.

### Night Markets

Taiwan was our favorite vacation yet. We hope to go back many times!
