Shelley and I spent two weeks in Japan this winter. She had been before, I had
not. Here's a list of some random things that popped into mind what I'd suggest
you keep in mind if you ever visit too:

- **Winter in Japan is cold.** Pack accordingly. We brought many layers of
  clothes (of particular note, Uniqlo's Heattech innerwear), our warmest coats,
  snow boots, and gloves. If you follow our lead on destinations, know that
  there isn't much latitudinal difference between Tokyo and Hiroshima, so
  unless you're heading to Okinawa, plan on bundling up the entire trip.
- **Translator apps are your friend.** It's a good idea to have Google
  Translate handy, especially when you're at home. Shelley and I shivered
  through our first night because we couldn't figure out how to read, and
  therefore operate, the wall-mounted heater in our room. The next morning, we
  called her mother to help translate. She kindly reminded us that we could
  have done it ourselves with the cameras on our phones.
- **Find a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot.** Some Airbnb hosts will give you one as an
  amenity. They are really convenient to carry around with you during the day,
  especially if you are getting spotty service or don't have a global mobile
  data plan. You can stick it in your purse or backpack and use it everywhere
  you go. Just be sure to bring an extra battery or turn it off when not in
  use.
- **Convenience stores, or _konbini_, are a sight.** Go to them often. Lawsons
  is one of the most popular ones. We liked to visit them on our way home each
  night to pick up snacks or breakfast for the following morning. Don't worry
  too much about utility of your purchases; the point of a tourist pit stop at
  a konbini is to buy weird things and hope they turn out to be awesome weird
  things. (Some of the 7/11s have ATMs, though.)
- **Department stores are a wonder too.** Every floor is different than the
  ones that came before, so you never know what you might find on the next. Don
  Quijote, a chain of famous discount stores, is maybe the most bizarre of them
  all, so much so that you just need to go on your own.
- **And don't forget the arcades.** Children, but more so young(-ish) adults,
  in Japan fill these up from about dinner time on into the night. Even if you
  don't want to play games, walk through a few in hopes of catching a glimpse
  of some of the more engaged plays. It's not uncommon to find someone clearing
  out a claw machine or breaking the record on a rhythm game.
- **Take the Shinkansen.** This is an absolute must. The Shinkansen is the
  major high-speed rail system in Japan, and it runs like clockwork. We had
  a good time buying some bento boxes ahead of each ride and eating along the
  way between cities. The views of the countryside, especially in the snowy
  winter, are great.
- **Get the JR Rail Pass.** Shinkansen tickets will cost you extra, but if you
  plan on spending time crisscrossing a city like Tokyo for a week-plus long
  trip, the JR Rail Pass may be an economical decision. The pass will get you
  in and out of the major subway systems in most metros without any additional
  cost beyond the upfront price tag. Just flash a laminated card you receive
  upon arrival at the airport to the attendants at any subway turnstile and
  they'll kindly let you pass.
- **There's more to Japanese cuisine than sushi.** I love food, and Shelley and
  I plan most of our vacations around it, so this one is touch to fit in
  a single bullet. Just make sure you take full advantage of your time in Japan
  by eating as many different kinds of food as you can. Here's just a small
  list of some common dishes to give you some ideas: bento, curry, cutlet
  sandwiches, gyoza, katsudon, melonpan, miso soup, natt≈ç &#x1f64a;,
  okonomiyaki, onigiri, ramen, soba, sukiyaki, tempura, udon, yakitori.
- **Mind your manners.** Hopefully this one comes naturally for most, but the
  best way to stick out in Japanese public is to make a scene. People will
  actively help you save face if you make a mistake (they'd be severely
  second-hand embarrassed if they didn't), so just be flexible and courteous
  and you'll have a great time.
